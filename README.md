# KaraDAV - A lightweight WebDAV server, with NextCloud compatibility

This is WebDAV server serving a demonstration of the KD2\WebDAV and KD2\WebDAV_NextCloud components, allowing to easily set up a WebDAV file sharing server compatible with NextCloud clients with no depencies and high performance.

The only dependency is SQLite3.

Although this is a demo, this can be used as a simple but powerful file sharing server.

This server features:

* No database is required
* Multiple user accounts
* Share files for users using WebDAV: delete, create, update, mkdir, get, list
* Compatible with WebDAV clients
* Supports NextCloud Android app
* Supports NextCloud desktop app
* User-friendly directory listings for file browsing with a web browser:
	* Upload directly from browser
	* Rename
	* Delete
	* Create and edit text file
	* MarkDown live preview
	* Preview of images, text, MarkDown and PDF
* User-management through web UI

## Future development

It is not planned to implement CalDAV and CardDAV currently, but it might come in the future, in the mean time see [Sabre/DAV](https://sabre.io/dav/) for that.

## Dependencies

This depends on the KD2\WebDAV and KD2\WebDAV_NextCloud classes from the [KD2FW package](https://fossil.kd2.org/kd2fw/), which are packaged in this repository.

These are lightweight and easy to use in your own software to add this feature to your product.

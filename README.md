# KaraDAV - A lightweight WebDAV server, with NextCloud compatibility

This is WebDAV server, allowing to easily set up a WebDAV file sharing server compatible with NextCloud clients with no depencies and high performance.

The only dependency is SQLite3 for the database.

Although this is a demo, this can be used as a simple but powerful file sharing server.

This server features:

* WebDAV class 1, 2, 3 support, support for Etags
* No database is required
* Multiple user accounts
* Share files for users using WebDAV: delete, create, update, mkdir, get, list
* Compatible with WebDAV clients
* Support for HTTP ranges (partial download)
* Support for [RFC 3230](https://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc3230.xhtml) to get the MD5 digest hash of a file (to check integrity) on `HEAD` requests (only MD5 is supported so far)
* Support for `Content-MD5` with `PUT` requests, see [dCache documentation for details](https://dcache.org/old/manuals/UserGuide-6.0/webdav.shtml#checksums)
* Support for some of the [Microsoft proprietary properties](https://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/webdavfaq.html)

* User-friendly directory listings for file browsing with a web browser:
	* Upload directly from browser
	* Rename
	* Delete
	* Create and edit text file
	* MarkDown live preview
	* Preview of images, text, MarkDown and PDF
* User-management through web UI

## NextCloud compatibility

* Android app
* Desktop app (tested on Debian)
* [NextCloud CLI client](https://docs.nextcloud.com/desktop/3.5/advancedusage.html)
* Support for [Direct download API](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/client_apis/OCS/ocs-api-overview.html#direct-download)

## WebDAV clients compatibility

* [FUSE webdavfs](https://github.com/miquels/webdavfs) is recommended for Linux
* davfs2 is NOT recommended: it is very slow, and it is using a local cache, meaning changing a file locally may not be synced to the server for a few minutes, leading to things getting out of sync. If you have to use it, at least disable locks, by setting `use_locks=0` in the config.

## Future development

This might get supported in future (maybe):

* [Partial upload via PATCH](https://github.com/miquels/webdav-handler-rs/blob/master/doc/SABREDAV-partialupdate.md)
* [Chunk upload](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/client_apis/WebDAV/chunking.html)
* [NextCloud Trashbin](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/client_apis/WebDAV/trashbin.html)
* [NextCloud sharing](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/client_apis/OCS/ocs-share-api.html) (maybe?)
* [WebDAV sharing](https://evertpot.com/webdav-caldav-carddav-sharing/)
* [Extended MKCOL](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5689) if CalDAV support is implemented
* CalDAV/CardDAV support: maybe, [why not](https://evertpot.com/227/), we'll see, in the mean time see [Sabre/DAV](https://sabre.io/dav/) for that.

## Dependencies

This depends on the KD2\WebDAV and KD2\WebDAV_NextCloud classes from the [KD2FW package](https://fossil.kd2.org/kd2fw/), which are packaged in this repository.

They are lightweight and easy to use in your own software to add support for WebDAV and NextCloud clients to your software.

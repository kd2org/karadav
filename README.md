# KaraDAV - A lightweight WebDAV server, with NextCloud compatibility

This is WebDAV server, allowing to easily set up a WebDAV file sharing server compatible with NextCloud clients with no depencies and high performance.

The only dependency is SQLite3 for the database.

Although this is a demo, this can be used as a simple but powerful file sharing server.

This server features:

* WebDAV class 1, 2, 3 support, support for Etags
* No database is required
* Multiple user accounts
* Share files for users using WebDAV: delete, create, update, mkdir, get, list
* Compatible with WebDAV clients
* Support for HTTP ranges (partial download)

* User-friendly directory listings for file browsing with a web browser:
	* Upload directly from browser
	* Rename
	* Delete
	* Create and edit text file
	* MarkDown live preview
	* Preview of images, text, MarkDown and PDF
* User-management through web UI

## NextCloud compatibility

* Android app
* Desktop app (tested on Debian)
* [NextCloud CLI client](https://docs.nextcloud.com/desktop/3.5/advancedusage.html)
* Support for [Direct download API](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/client_apis/OCS/ocs-api-overview.html#direct-download)

## Future development

This might get supported in future (maybe):

* [Chunk upload](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/client_apis/WebDAV/chunking.html)
* [NextCloud Trashbin](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/client_apis/WebDAV/trashbin.html)
* [NextCloud sharing](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/client_apis/OCS/ocs-share-api.html) (maybe?)
* [Extended MKCOL](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5689) if CalDAV support is implemented
* CalDAV/CardDAV support: maybe, why not, we'll see, in the mean time see [Sabre/DAV](https://sabre.io/dav/) for that.

## Dependencies

This depends on the KD2\WebDAV and KD2\WebDAV_NextCloud classes from the [KD2FW package](https://fossil.kd2.org/kd2fw/), which are packaged in this repository.

They are lightweight and easy to use in your own software to add support for WebDAV and NextCloud clients to your software.
